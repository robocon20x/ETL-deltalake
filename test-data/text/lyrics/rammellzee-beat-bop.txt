Get funky in the place!
Get funky in the place!
It’s pathetic dope addicts have to be abused
It’s a shame what a day to be a prostitute
Life is given to us just to do the right thing
Instead of that we came a ho or a big dope fiend
Make you feel real bad every time I see
Another bum or brother sleeping on the street
In the corner in the morning every night and day
It’s a pity so many people try to act gay
Everybody’s turning crazy so you’d better believe
To do the right things or soon you’ll see
Life ain’t a moral joke it’s a serious thing
When you’re dealing with the answers that you can’t explain
New York City is a place of mysteries
Drug addicts dope dealers taking over the streets
That me is always saying why the hell do we pay?
What for they break the laws and get a couple of days
No sense tryin’ to help there’s really no use
Think of us messing up lectating at you
Hot rocks tryin’ to pop with no respect
Niggas waiting at the station for the big pay cheque
Home boys going bakin’ on Thursday night
Girls waiting in the house for Mr. Right
Kids going to school just to be a fool
Never want to learn work just a polin’ on you babe
It’s the funky beat and it’s the funky beat
And it’s the funk, the funk and it’s the funky beat
Yeah

This is the mellow they call the Rammell
That rocks you with the rhythm that’ll shock your spell
When the shake-up kid that wakes you up in the morning
Gotta rape with the rhythm like a number one groanin’
MC quick just to make your peanut butter
Shock with the rhythm of a number one undercover
Break it up just shake it up rodeo uh
Break it up just shake it up rodeo uh
I’m the mellow D down with the funky sound
That can mace your brain with my diamond studded crown
Just a makin’ you dip like a little bitty dive
Live a prick just bakin’ your hide
Rock on to the break of dawn
Just freak that yeah baby

Like the little jelly-bean I’m a sweet like a candy-cane
Make you get down just the number one stain on the train

Just groovin’ with the rhythm as I shake your rump
You gotta rock rock you don’t stop the baby y’all

Just a rock on like the finger lick
Finger popping hop popping now don’t stop bunny rock
Bunny rock and you don’t stop
That long finger nail at the end of my tip
Of my pinkie cocaine make you slip a my lip
Just make you freak when a panny wanny with clip
Got the little pat to the dab’ll make you my hip
Shake shake rock body rock the hip and the hop

Because the music is down when your body want to shake
Gotta hip hop and then baby dog get down

Get shade yeah, shade it up with the glasses

[Verse 3: K Rob]
Smoke cheeba, into whores, drinking all week through
Never want to go to school and that’s a fact
Till all of a sudden you got left back
Now you’re feeling real low like mighty Herc
And your friends are snapping on you like you’re a jerk
Now things are hard and you’re really depressed
And your mind can’t function cause you can’t pass the test
You’re saying to yourself what can I do?
I can’t go home, I might as well quit school
Jobs are hard to find everybody knows
And you can’t do crime cause you’re on parole
No education is a big disgrace and
So you might as well work at the sanitation
Can you get my drift?
Get funky in the place

I know the man that gets with the deal
That rocks like the pimps that acts real real
He can get real ill when you’re on the chill
I like the quarter drop a dime
That can make you seek a thrill
Master killer called the Evil Griller

All the time that you been hanging out with your friends
You never took the effort to see what’s happening
Crime, crime, crime can’t get it off my mind
Cause it’s a thing we have to face all the damn time
People always say why do they break the laws
Gonna tell you right now it’s cause of all a y’all
That’s a go like ebola, gonna let it be told
It doesn’t matter to a thief if you’re young or old
Just money they wanting they need it bad
And to take another person’s life it makes them feel glad
So rock, to the funky beat

Rockin’ better rockin’ better on the radio set
And if you did and if you did please tell me now

Rock on to the break of dawn
Rock on to the break of dawn
Seven twenty six

Bust a move
Well I was coming from school it was three o’clock
Had no money in my pocket broke to the last drop
I had no way of getting home
I was really messed up cause I was all alone
I felt the real sick and very confused
And my heart was pumping fast I think it was the booze
And my legs felt the weak and I couldn’t walk
Got pains in my chest when I tried to talk
I said, ‘Oh God it had to happen to me’
‘Give me a chance to straighten up and get a J-O-B’
'Cause I’m the type of person who likes to play
And at the time I had a drink and got carried away
You know everybody once made a mistake
It’s not too late to straighten up so give me a break
I’ll go to church and do my work instead of being a jerk
As a doctor or a lawyer even desk clerk
Whatever you say I must do
'Cause you’re the one and only and I trust you
Crime is going up....
